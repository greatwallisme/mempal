pub const MEMORY_PROTOCOL: &str = r#"MEMPAL MEMORY PROTOCOL (for AI agents)

You have persistent project memory via mempal. Follow these rules in every session:

0. FIRST-TIME SETUP (once per session)
   Call mempal_status() once at the start of any session to discover available
   wings and their drawer counts. Only use wing/room filters on mempal_search
   AFTER you have seen the exact wing name in that status response (or the
   user explicitly named it). Guessing a wing (e.g. "engineering", "backend")
   silently returns zero results. When uncertain, leave wing/room unset for a
   global search.

1. WAKE UP
   Some clients (Claude Code with SessionStart hooks) pre-load recent wing/room
   context above. Others (Codex, Cursor, raw MCP clients) do NOT — for those,
   step 0 is how you wake up. Trust drawer_ids and source_file citations in
   any results you receive; they reference real files on disk.

2. VERIFY BEFORE ASSERTING
   Before stating project facts ("we chose X", "we use Y", "the auth flow is Z"),
   call mempal_search to confirm. Never guess from general knowledge when the
   user is asking about THIS project.

3. QUERY WHEN UNCERTAIN
   When the user asks about past decisions, historical context, "why did we...",
   "last time we...", or "what was the decision about...", call mempal_search
   with their question. Do not rely on conversation memory alone.

3a. TRANSLATE QUERIES TO ENGLISH
   The default embedding model is a multilingual distillation (model2vec) but
   still performs best with English queries. Non-English queries may miss
   relevant results. When the user's question is in Chinese, Japanese, Korean,
   or any other non-English language, translate the semantic intent into English
   BEFORE passing it as the query string to mempal_search. Do NOT transliterate
   — capture the meaning. Example: user says "它不再是一个高级原型" → search
   for "no longer just an advanced prototype".

4. SAVE AFTER DECISIONS
   When a decision is reached in the conversation (especially one with reasons),
   call mempal_ingest to persist it. Include the rationale, not just the
   decision. Use the current project's wing; let mempal auto-route the room.

5. CITE EVERYTHING
   Every mempal_search result includes drawer_id and source_file. Reference them
   when you answer: "according to drawer X from /path/to/file, we decided...".
   Citations are what separate memory from hallucination.

5a. KEEP A DIARY
   After completing a session's work, optionally record behavioral observations
   using mempal_ingest with wing="agent-diary" and room=your-agent-name (e.g.
   "claude", "codex"). Prefix entries with OBSERVATION:, LESSON:, or PATTERN:
   to categorize. Diary entries help future sessions of any agent learn from
   past behavioral patterns. Example: "LESSON: always check repo docs before
   writing infrastructure code."

8. PARTNER AWARENESS (cross-agent cowork)
   When the user references the partner coding agent ("Codex 那边...",
   "ask Claude what...", "partner is working on...", "handoff..."), call
   mempal_peek_partner to read the partner's LIVE session rather than
   searching mempal drawers. Live conversation is transient and stays in
   session logs, not mempal. Use peek for CURRENT partner state; use
   mempal_search for CRYSTALLIZED past decisions. Don't conflate the two.
   Pass tool="auto" to infer the partner from the MCP client you are
   connected through, or name it explicitly (claude / codex).

9. DECISION CAPTURE (what goes into mempal)
   mempal_ingest is for decisions, not chat logs. A drawer-worthy item is
   one where the user (and you, optionally with partner agent input via
   peek) have reached a firm conclusion: an architectural choice, a
   naming/API contract, a bug root cause + patch, a spec change. Do NOT
   ingest brainstorming scratchpad, intermediate exploration, or raw
   conversation. When the decision was shaped by partner involvement
   (you called mempal_peek_partner this turn), include the partner's key
   points in the drawer body so the drawer is self-contained without
   re-peeking. Cite the partner session file path in source_file alongside
   your own citation.

10. COWORK PUSH (proactive handoff to partner)
   Call mempal_cowork_push when YOU (the agent) want the partner agent
   to see something on their next user turn. This is a SEND primitive —
   orthogonal to mempal_peek_partner (READ live state) and mempal_ingest
   (PERSIST decisions). Typical use: partner should notice a status
   update, blocker, or in-flight decision that is too transient for a
   drawer but too important for the user to have to relay manually.

   Delivery semantics: at-next-UserPromptSubmit, NOT real-time. The
   partner's TUI does not re-render on external events; delivery happens
   when the user types their next prompt in the partner's session,
   triggering the UserPromptSubmit hook which drains the inbox and
   injects via the standard hook stdout protocol.

   Addressing: pass target_tool="claude" or target_tool="codex" to
   choose explicitly, or omit to infer partner from MCP client identity.
   Self-push (target == you) is rejected.

   When NOT to push:
   - Content you also want to persist → use mempal_ingest (drawers)
   - Trigger partner mid-turn → not supported (at-next-submit only)
   - Broadcast to multiple targets → one target per push
   - Rich content / file attachments → only plain text body (≤ 8 KB)

   On InboxFull error: STOP pushing and wait for partner to drain. Do
   NOT retry — that would just fail again.

TOOLS:
  mempal_status        — current state + this protocol + AAAK format spec
  mempal_search        — semantic search with wing/room filters, citation-bearing
  mempal_ingest        — save a new drawer (wing required, room optional, importance 0-5)
  mempal_delete        — soft-delete a drawer by ID
  mempal_taxonomy      — list or edit routing keywords
  mempal_kg            — knowledge graph: add/query/invalidate/timeline/stats triples
  mempal_tunnels       — discover cross-wing room links
  mempal_peek_partner  — read partner agent's live session (Claude ↔ Codex), pure read
  mempal_cowork_push   — send a short handoff message to partner agent (P8)

Key invariant: mempal stores raw text verbatim. Every search result can be
traced back to a source_file. If you cannot cite the source, you are guessing."#;
